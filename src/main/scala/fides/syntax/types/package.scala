package fides.syntax

/**
  * This package provides the type machinery to express the syntax of Fides.
  *
  * There are four main levels of "types":
  * <ol>
  * <li> <b>Data types</b> characterize data/values.
  * <li> <b>Grammar types</b> characterize code, except for escapes.
  * <li> <b>Meta types</b> are also called scapes; they fully characterize code, including escapes.
  * <li> <b>Code types</b> represent actual code.
  * </ol>
